# Pass-Flow

**Create animated flow velocity fields using passing data.**

### EXPERIMENTAL

It is recommended to run this notebook in Google Colab to start with as all requirements can be installed in one click.

Known issues:
- StatsBomb data format only
- Trial and error required to adjust the field grid dimensions - code can hang when changing the default values to some other values, but will be fine fine with others.
